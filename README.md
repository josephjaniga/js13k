A one button pixel platformer backwards infinite runner. With such amazing features as CAMERA SHAKE, JUMP, SOUND, background MUSIC (on chrome), DOUBLE JUMP, and most importantly MOVING TO THE LEFT!

Works in FireFox... plays best on Chrome.

Space to Start! Space to Jump! Space to Double Jump! Space to ALL THE THINGS!
